JSON is like a data transfer between the server to an api and the transformation is done which brings  a human readable format at both ends. The data is structured and serialized. 
In this example the user's public tweets are displayed sequentially similar to the twitter timeline.  

This only works for tweets which are set to public privacy option otherwise a blank screen is encountered.

I got this url from a blog who display their tweets under the public setting.

Thank you
